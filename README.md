# Data Security With Blockchain and AI

## Overview
This project demonstrates a solution for enhancing **data security** by integrating **Blockchain** technology with **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**. The aim is to provide a secure system for data management and authentication, using modern technologies such as Blockchain for decentralized data storage and AI for detecting security threats.

## Technologies Used
- **Blockchain**: To store data securely and prevent unauthorized access.
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: For detecting anomalies and enhancing the security of the system.
- **SQL**: For data management and storage.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Frontend technologies used for creating the user interface.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install SQL Software
To run this project, you’ll need to set up an SQL database. Choose from the following options:
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)

### 2. Set Up the Database
Once you have installed the SQL software, create a database to hold the project data. For example, in **MySQL**:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE data_security;
```
After creating the database, you can create tables and import the necessary datasets as required for your project.

### 3. Install Node.js and Blockchain Dependencies
To interact with the blockchain network, you will need to install Node.js and some additional dependencies like Web3.js or Ethers.js.

Install Node.js from here.

Run the following commands to install necessary blockchain dependencies:

```bash
npm install web3
```
For Ethereum, you can use Hardhat or Truffle to deploy and test smart contracts:

```bash
npm install --save-dev hardhat
```
### 4. Set Up and Train AI Model
The AI model is used for detecting anomalies in the data. You’ll need to set up a Python environment and install dependencies:

Install Python from here.

Install the necessary Python libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow pyTorch
```
Train your AI model using the dataset and ensure it can detect anomalies.

### 5. Deploy Blockchain Smart Contracts
If using Ethereum, deploy smart contracts to the blockchain:

Write and deploy smart contracts using Solidity.

For Ethereum, use Truffle or Hardhat:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <your-network>
```
### 6. Run the Application
Once everything is set up, you can start your application. Run the frontend using:

```bash
npm run start
```
And start the AI module by running:

```bash
python detect_anomalies.py
```
Your application should now be live and connected to both the blockchain network and the AI anomaly detection module.

# Usage
1. Blockchain Network: Interact with the blockchain by submitting transactions (storing or retrieving data).

2. AI Detection: The AI model continuously monitors the data for any anomalies, predicting potential threats based on the data.

3. Smart Contracts: Ensure that data access is managed through automated smart contracts.

4. Authentication: The system uses AI-driven authentication (e.g., face/voice recognition) for secure access to the platform.
